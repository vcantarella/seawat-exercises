# seawat-exercises

This repository shows my solutions in Flopy (Bakker et al. 2016) for the problems that were proposed by Gualbert Oude Essink's IHE saltwater-freshwater interface modelling class.

The exercises are based on common benchmark problem for saltwater intrusion in groundwater (Henry's Case, Elder's Case and Fresh Water Lens).

The notes and PMWIN solutions can be accessed below (August, 2021):

The modelling is done in jupyter notebooks

Each notebook includes building the model from scratch:
  - MODLFOW inputs
  - MT3DMS inputs
  - SEAWAT inputs
And post-processing results:
  - Heads
  - Concentrations
  - Ouput at specific locations
  - Comparison with Analytical Solutions
